# Medieval Survival Demo

This small demo uses Node, Express and Socket.io with Phaser.

## Running the game

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

If you open `public/index.html` directly without running the server,
the game will now create a local world so you can still move around,
but multiplayer features will be disabled.
